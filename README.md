# Coding Agent

A lightweight, self-hosted coding assistant that runs in your terminal **and** your browser. Tell it what you want, and it will read files, run shell commands, edit code, search your project, and explain every step in real time.

## Why Coding Agent?

- **🔧 Real tools, real actions** — it can run `bash`, read/write/edit files, search code, and load project-specific skills.
- **⚡ Streaming, explainable output** — see the model's reasoning, tool calls, and live command output as they happen.
- **🖥️ Clean web UI** — one command starts both the gateway and the web interface; no separate terminal client needed.
- **💾 Persistent sessions** — conversations are saved locally as JSONL, so you can pick up where you left off.
- **🔒 Self-hosted** — your API key stays on your machine; everything runs locally.
